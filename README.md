## My Roadmap

My eventual goal is to build fully autonomous robots. The skills I am focusing on developing through these projects include:

* [x] Basic GPIO Control (Outputs)
* [x] GPIO Inputs (Buttons, Sensors)
* [x] PWM Control (Servos, Motor Speed)
* [ ] Computer Vision with OpenCV
* [ ] Applied AI/ML on the Edge (Object Detection)
* [ ] Mobile Robotics (Chassis, Motors, Navigation)
* [ ] The Robot Operating System (ROS 2)
